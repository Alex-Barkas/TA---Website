PDF Answer Keys - Instructions
==============================

This folder contains the answer key PDFs for tutorial sessions.

Folder Structure:
----------------
- APSC171/  - Answer keys for APSC 171 (Calculus I for Engineers)
- APSC172/  - Answer keys for APSC 172 (Calculus II for Engineers)

Naming Convention:
------------------
Place your PDF files in the appropriate course folder with this naming pattern:

For APSC 171:
  - week1_answerkey.pdf
  - week2_answerkey.pdf
  - week3_answerkey.pdf
  ... and so on through week12_answerkey.pdf

For APSC 172:
  - week1_answerkey.pdf
  - week2_answerkey.pdf
  - week3_answerkey.pdf
  ... and so on through week12_answerkey.pdf

How It Works:
-------------
Once you place a PDF file in the correct folder with the correct name, it will
automatically appear on the corresponding week's detail page on your website.

Example:
--------
If you have the answer key for APSC 171 Week 3, save it as:
  pdfs/APSC171/week3_answerkey.pdf

The website will automatically display it when students view Week 3 of APSC 171.

Note:
-----
- PDFs are displayed in an embedded viewer on each week's page
- Students can also click "Open PDF in new tab" to view/download the PDF
- Make sure PDF filenames match exactly (case-sensitive): week1_answerkey.pdf
